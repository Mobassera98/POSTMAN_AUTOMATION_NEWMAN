# POSTMAN_AUTOMATION_NEWMAN
Write API Tests with Postman and Newman

Postman

•	A postman is a good tool that we mostly use to quickly test APIs to see the result returned by them, but it's way more powerful than that.
•	Making API is hard but Postman makes it simpler, easier.
•	You can simply test any API and see the response immediately.
•	You can create a collection of API endpoints and call them whenever you want to see the responses.

Newman

•	We Write Tests in Postman, then export the collection and use Newman to run them directly from the command line.
